# Rainfall-Prediction-end-to-end-ML-project

The main motive of the project is to predict the amount of rainfall in Vidarbha region or state well in advance. We predict average rainfall using past data.

# CONCLUSION

XGBoost and Random Forest performed better compared to other models. However, if speed is an important thing to consider, we can stick with Random Forest instead of XGBoost.

# Improvements that can be done:

Here we can collect more data and use neurals networks
more computational power could be really usefull for us
